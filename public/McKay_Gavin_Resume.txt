* Implementing an eye tracker for using grid-based app and for playing semi-complex turn-based games
User Activity Log – Data Structures & Algorithms
* Developed a Java-based log management system with a partner, implementing a Map ADT and array-based list for efficient log storage.
* Applied quicksort and bubble sort to generate sorted reports.
* Utilized Singleton and Strategy design patterns for centralized management and flexible sorting logic.
Backlog Manager – Software Fundamentals
* Created a Java-based backlog management system to track products with assigned tasks and owners.
* Implemented exception handling.
Pack Scheduler – Software Fundamentals Lab
* Collaborated with a team of programmers to build a Java-based course registration system for students.
